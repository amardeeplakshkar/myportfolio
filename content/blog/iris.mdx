IRIS (Intelligent Response & Information System) started as a simple idea: what if a single assistant could handle conversation, image generation, diagram rendering, weather lookup, and media transcription — all from the same interface?  

What grew from that idea is **IRIS**: a modern, multimodal AI assistant built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and the OpenAI ecosystem. It’s designed to be developer-friendly, responsive, and extendable — whether you want to prototype features quickly or ship a production-ready assistant.

## 🚀 Overview

- 💬 Chat naturally with AI using text
- 🖼️ Generate and understand images

- ⚡ Experience fast, modern, and interactive UI
