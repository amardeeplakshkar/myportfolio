title: Building ClumpUI – A Unified React Component Registry
description: One place, every component. My journey creating ClumpUI.

For a long time, I found myself switching between different React component libraries. Some had amazing animations, others were great at accessibility, and a few offered beautiful design systems. But I kept wishing there was **one place** where I could access the best of them — without being locked into just a single design language.  

That’s how **ClumpUI** was born.  

ClumpUI is a **unified component registry** that aggregates the best UI patterns from multiple libraries like **shadcn/ui**, **Magic UI**, **Kokonut UI**, and more. Instead of reinventing the wheel, it curates, organizes, and streamlines the process of bringing production-ready components into your project.  

## Why ClumpUI?  

When you start a new project, you usually face the same decision: *Which UI library should I commit to?* But each library comes with trade-offs — one may lack animations, another may not be responsive out of the box, or maybe it doesn’t fully support theming.  

With ClumpUI, you don’t have to choose. You can:  

- Pull in a **Particle Button** inspired by animated libraries  
- Add a **Bento Grid** or **Apple Activity Card** with one click  
- Build interfaces mixing and matching from different sources — all in a consistent way  

It’s like having a **component marketplace** right inside your project.  

## Features That Matter  

ClumpUI isn’t just a collection — it’s a system designed for real-world development:  

- 🎨 **200+ Components** ready to use  
- 📦 **One-Click Install** via shadcn CLI  
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Themes** with Tailwind v4  
- ⚡ **Next.js 15 + Turbopack** for blazing-fast dev experience  
- ♿ **Accessibility** as a core principle  
- 🎭 **Multiple Styles** — borrow from any ecosystem  
- 🔧 **Customizable** for your brand and product needs  

## Component Categories  

Here are some highlights:  

- **AI Components** – AI input search, voice interfaces, loading states  
- **Text Components** – glitch text, typewriter, shimmer, matrix effects  
- **Button Components** – gradient, particle, hold, switch, command buttons  
- **Card Components** – flip, stack, liquid glass, carousel, tweet cards  
- **Other Essentials** – bento grids, navigation, profile dropdowns, background effects  

Every component is built with **TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and accessibility-first patterns**.  

## Quick Start  

If you want to try ClumpUI locally, setup is simple:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amardeeplakshkar/clumpui.git
cd clumpui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Or install a component directly into your project with the CLI:  

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://clumpui.amardeep.space/r/particle-button
```

Then just import it:  

```tsx
import ParticleButton from "@/components/ui/particle-button"

export default function Page() {
  return <ParticleButton>Click me!</ParticleButton>
}
```

That’s it — you’re ready to go.  

## Under the Hood  

ClumpUI is powered by **Next.js App Router** with a registry-based architecture. Each component lives in its own registry folder, is defined in \`registry.json\`, and can be fetched or installed dynamically.  

It uses:  

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with custom tokens for design consistency  
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations  
- **Radix Primitives** for accessibility  
- **TypeScript** for reliability  

This makes the system highly **extensible**, so adding new components or categories is as easy as dropping in a new file and rebuilding the registry.  

## Contributions  

ClumpUI is an evolving ecosystem, and I welcome contributions from developers and designers who want to make components better. The goal is to make it a **community-driven registry** that grows with the needs of the React ecosystem.  

## Final Thoughts  

With ClumpUI, my goal was to create **a single place for every component you could possibly need**. Whether you’re building dashboards, landing pages, or AI-driven interfaces, you can mix and match the best UI elements without getting locked into one library.
