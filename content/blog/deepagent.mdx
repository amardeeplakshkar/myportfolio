In today’s landscape, applications are no longer static — they need to think, adapt, and integrate seamlessly with dozens of APIs. That’s the motivation behind **DeepAgent**, an **agentic SDK for modern applications**.  

Instead of wiring up endless APIs manually, DeepAgent gives you **50+ pre-built integrations** out of the box — from AI to business intelligence, communication, CRM, search, and more. It’s built entirely in **TypeScript**, designed to work universally across **Node.js, browsers, and edge environments**, and ready for production.  

## 🚀 Why DeepAgent?  

While building intelligent apps, I found myself repeating the same work: connecting APIs, writing boilerplate, handling errors, and managing authentication. Every project started the same way.  

DeepAgent changes that by offering:  

- **50+ Pre-built Integrations** – APIs like GitHub, OpenAI, Twilio, Airtable, Notion, and more  
- **100% TypeScript** – End-to-end type safety with strong definitions  
- **Zero Configuration** – Plug and play with sensible defaults  
- **Universal Compatibility** – Node.js, browser, edge-ready  
- **Production Ready** – Error handling and best practices included  
- **Modular Architecture** – Install only the integrations you need  

It’s like having an **agent toolkit** that grows with your app.  

## 📦 Quick Start  

Install any integration package directly:  

```bash
# npm
npm install @deepagent/github

# yarn
yarn add @deepagent/github

# pnpm
pnpm add @deepagent/github
```

Example with GitHub:  

```ts
import { GitHubClient } from '@deepagent/github'

const github = new GitHubClient({
  apiKey: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN
})

// Fetch repository info
const repo = await github.getRepository({
  owner: 'amardeeplakshkar',
  repo: 'deepagent'
})

// Create a new issue
await github.createIssue({
  owner: 'amardeeplakshkar',
  repo: 'deepagent',
  title: 'New feature request',
  body: 'Description of the feature'
})
```

Within minutes, your app can automate workflows that usually take hours of setup.  

## 🔌 50+ Integrations Out of the Box  

DeepAgent is packed with integrations across multiple domains:  

- **AI & ML**: OpenAI, Midjourney, xAI  
- **Search & Data**: Google, Bing, Brave, Exa, Tavily, SearxNG  
- **Business & CRM**: Airtable, Notion, Apollo, Proxycurl, RocketReach, LeadMagic, ZoomInfo  
- **Communication**: Slack, Twilio, Novu  
- **Social Media**: Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube  
- **Web & Content**: GitHub, Google Drive, Firecrawl, Diffbot  
- **Knowledge & Research**: Wikipedia, Arxiv, WolframAlpha, HackerNews  
- **Utilities**: Calculator, Weather APIs, Jina, Typeform, Polygon  

Each integration is published as its own `@deepagent/*` package, independently versioned and fully typed.  

## 🏗 Built with Turborepo  

DeepAgent is a **monorepo** powered by Turborepo:  

- 📚 **Docs**: Built with Next.js + Fumadocs  
- 📦 **Packages**: 50+ integration clients  
- ✅ **Testing & Linting**: Robust setup for reliability  
- 🚢 **Automated Releases**: Changesets + GitHub Actions for npm publishing  

This makes contributions and scaling the ecosystem much easier.  

## 🎯 Use Cases  

- **AI-Powered Automation** – Automate GitHub PRs, run Slack notifications, publish content across platforms  
- **Data Intelligence** – Aggregate Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube data for market insights  
- **CRM Enhancement** – Lead generation, enrichment, and outreach with Apollo, ZoomInfo, Hunter, etc.  
- **Smart Workflows** – Mix multiple APIs to build orchestrated agents  

## 👨‍💻 Contributing  

DeepAgent is **open source under MIT**. Contributions are welcome:  

1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a feature branch  
3. Add or improve an integration  
4. Submit a PR  

Each integration follows strict guidelines: TypeScript-first, tested, and fully documented.  

## 📈 Final Thoughts  

With DeepAgent, my goal was to create an SDK that makes **building agents as simple as installing npm packages**. Instead of re-implementing integrations, you can focus on logic and intelligence while DeepAgent handles the heavy lifting.
